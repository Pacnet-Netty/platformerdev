RiceBall platformerdev

=============

RiceBall is about Riceball, a character who is a rice ball. RiceBall is a platformer in which you travel through colorful 2D maps (this is a platformer game) and squash enemies (the sushi) while collecting powerups.

RiceBall is currently in development by PacDim, a coalition between dimSum and pac.net who wish to create an indie game (why not?).

The game is to be developed using XNA 3.1 and Visual C# 2008. It's a Windows exclusive game and may require the .NET 3.5 Redistributable Framework for clients.

dimSum is mainly focused on creating graphics and pac.net is mainly focused on the programming of the game.
