RiceBall platformerdev
=============

RiceBall is about Riceball, a character who is a rice ball. RiceBall is a platformer in which you sustain Riceball by travelling through 2D maps (this is a platformer game) and squash enemies while collecting powerups.

RiceBall is currently in development by PacDim, a coalition between dimSum and pac.net who wish to create an indie game (why not?).

The game is to be developed using SDL and Visual C++ 2012. It's likely to be a Windows exclusive game.

dimSum is mainly focused on creating graphics (possibly level design too?) and pac.net is mainly focused on the programming of the game.
